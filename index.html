            <h3>A4 motorway</h3>
            <p>The 1940 photo shows the area north of the District and Piccadilly railway lines as entirely residential. The 1966 photo shows the new motorway constructed in YEAR. Previously, the beautiful terraced houses north of the railway, constructed in YEAR for “bachelor artists”, looked out over the playing fields of PARK, which in YEAR gave way to the Hammersmith College (see <a href="#section-1966-1981">1966-81</a>). Today those houses look out over 6 lanes of never-ending traffic. </p>
            <p>The motorway was bulldozed through Victorian terraces purchased by compulsory purchase order [?], with many streets disconnected into a southern and a northern part. Previously traffic flowed along Hammersmith Road and King Street, badly unsuited to the volume of traffic.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="feature" id="1940-66-charingx">
            <h3>Fulham Hospital / Charing Cross Hospital</h3>
            <p>Fulham Hospital started as the Fulham Parish Infirmary, built for inmates of Fulham Workhouse. In 1884 it opened as the Fulham Hospital, and during WW1 it was taken over by the War Office to become Fulham Military Hospital. The original buildings are visible in the 1940 photo. In World War II, the hospital received wounded soldiers from Dunkirk, and was subject to bomb damage several times.</p>
            <p>
              During the 1950s, the workhouse building was demolished, and in 1957 it was announced that the hospital would merge with the Charing Cross Hospital – then located around five miles to the east in central London. From the late 1950s onwards, construction of a new hospital progressed. 
              The 1966 photo shows a vast construction site, with a few new buildings. It was completed in 1973 at a cost of £15m, then the most expensive hospital project in the UK to date. See <a href="#section-1966-1981">1966-81</a> for its completion.
            </p>

          <div class="feature" id="1940-66-fieldroad">
            <h3>Field Road Estate</h3>
            <p>The 1940 photo shows the Victorian houses that made way for the Field Road housing estate, between Margravine Cemetery and Greyhound Road.</p>
            <p>The 1966 photo shows the estate nearing completion but not yet occupied. The Muscal House tower block, along Greyhound Road, is not in the photo so it must have been constructed at a later date.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="feature" id="1940-66-clematlee">
            <h3>Clem Attlee Estate and Normand Park</h3>
            <p>In 1940 the areas now occupied by Clem Attlee Estate and Normand Park were mostly uniform terraced housing. 
              In the 1966 photo we can see, south of Lillie Road, the distinctive 3-pointed tower blocks of Clem Attlee estate, and the tower of Edith Summerskill House, recently demolished. North of Lillie Road we can see Normand Park, opened in 1952, with its bowling green. The area that became Fulham Pools is still empty. St Augustine’s and Normand Croft schools are also new.
              </p>
              <p>Normand Park was created on the site of a C17th villa, Normand House, after WWII bombing severely damaged property in the area. If you look at the <a href="https://www.layersoflondon.org/map/overlays/bomb-damage-1945" target="_blank">map of 1945 bomb damage <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon-small" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>
                <label class="js-special js-bombs1944-66"><input type="checkbox" checked> Show overlay</label>, you will see that both these areas south and north of Lillie Road were extensively damaged. In the C19th Normand House was used as an asylum, school and then a convent prior to its demolition.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature" id="1940-66-empress">
            <h3>Empress State Building</h3>
            <p>The building is named after the Empress Hall which formerly stood on the site, and in tribute to the Empire State Building. It was completed in 1962 for the Admiralty on the site of the former Empress Hall and ice rink as a commercial building and was 100 metres tall with 28 floors and was briefly the tallest commercial building in London.</p>
            <p>The Empress Hall can be seen in the 1940 photo. At the time it was being used as a refugee centre, as can be seen in photos at the <a href="https://www.londonpicturearchive.org.uk/quick-search?q=empress%20hall%20earls%20court&WINID=1729424466762" target="_blank">London Picture Archive <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon-small" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>. It was built in the late 1800s as the Empress Theatre for Imre Kiralfy, the Hungarian showman, and seated 6,000 people. In 1915 it was stripped out  to house Belgian refugees and by the end of the First World War it was being used as a storage depot. In 1935 it was converted into an ice skating rink and renamed the Empress Hall. Over the following years the building became known as the home of London's Ice Spectaculars, putting on a variety of musical extravaganzas on ice.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature" id="1940-66-lillierec">
            <h3>Lillie Recreation Ground (Lillie Rec)</h3>
            <p>Lillie Rec gets its name from Sir John Lillie, who started to develop the recreation ground in 1826. Fulham Football Club played here in 1884 and 1885. </p>
            <p>In 1891, the London County Council bought the land as a public park and began laying out the gardens, a ‘gymnasium’ with swings and see-saws, a sports area and a bandstand. The gardens opened to the public in December 1892. </p>
            <p>The park was taken over by the Fulham Borough council in 1900, and although some of the original features have been lost, the site still has a fitness centre as well as many sports and leisure facilities.</p>
            <p>The 1940 photo still shows the bandstand in the smaller triangle, replaced by several painted pitches on a tarmac surface in 1966.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature" id="1940-66-cemetery">
            <h3>Fulham Cemetery</h3>
            <p>In 1940 the cemetery was still densely packed with graves. They’re hard to see in this photo, but <a href="https://www.fulhamcemeteryfriends.org.uk/trees-wildlife/trees/tree-history#h.vesl26tn3icq" target="_blank">another aerial photo in 1949 <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon-small" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a></a> makes it much clearer. Perhaps due to the crowding there are very few trees. Two rows of trees are visible: the principal avenue from the Fulham Palace Road gate, and perpendicular to that, the main north-south avenue. They are not very large, if compared to the plane trees in Lille Rec. </p>
            <p>The picture in 1966 is very different. The council’s policy of “grassing over” older graves has made the cemetery become more park-like. The aerial photo points to a very deliberate programme of ornamental tree planting, probably during the 1950s, as they are already quite large in this photo.</p>
            <p>Here we can see the arrival of the cherry and crabapple avenues that became such a feature of the cemetery for over 70 years. Some of them still survive today. Two varieties of Japanese cherry were planted: Prunus ‘Kanzan’ and ‘Tai Haku’, and 3 varieties of Japanese crabapple: Malus halliana, floribunda, and toringo. Other ornamental flowering fruit trees were also planted: Pissard's cherry plum, medlar, and hawthorn.</p>
            <p>The same two avenues from the 1940 photo are visible here, but what is strange is that they’re not much different in size – not 26 years’ growth anyway. It looks like the avenues may have been replanted. </p>
            <p>The 3 large trees visible in both photos in the south of the cemetery – a horse chestnut and two maples – are still there today. </p>
            <p>Another poignant change in 1966 is the appearance of the war plot and war memorial.</p>

            <h3>Margravine Cemetery</h3>
            <p>These two photos illustrate a profound change to the landscape of Britain since the late 1960s: the arrival of Dutch Elm Disease. In the space of a decade, millions of elms were either killed by the disease or removed as a precautionary measure. Today, most people born after the mid-1970s have never seen a mature elm tree.</p>
            <p>In the 1966 photo you can clearly see the elm trees that lined the principal avenue from the hospital to the central round bed. You can see a photo of them from ground level taken in 1976 on the <a href="https://www.londonpicturearchive.org.uk/view-item?key=WnsiUCI6eyJrZXl3b3JkcyI6ImNlbWV0ZXJ5IiwicmVmaW5lU2VhcmNoIjoiVlhzaVVDSTZleUowWVhnaU9qVXNJblFpT2xzMU5UTTNYWDE5In19&pg=5&WINID=1729424466762#Z-lTLs9HLMUAAAGSqbsc5w/222355" target="_blank">London Picture Archive <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon-small" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>. In the 1981 photo they are gone. </p>
            <p>Elms were often planted in cemeteries. Since ancient times, the elm has held associations with death and the supernatural — perhaps because of the tree’s ability to resurrect itself from a stump. Coffins were commonly made from elm wood, as was the notorious ‘Tyburn Tree’ gallows in London.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="feature" id="1966-81-fulhamcem">
            <h3>Fulham Cemetery</h3>
            <p>We know for a fact that the trees in Margravine Cemetery were elms, confirmed by Ruth Savery of Friends of Margravine Cemetery who has photos of them. In the case of Fulham Cemetery, the case is more circumstantial. What is clear is that between these dates, the rows of trees lining the principal avenue and the central north-south avenue mysteriously disappeared. The similar circumstances make me confident that these were also victims of Dutch elm disease.</p>
            <p>Curiously, half of the north-south avenue survived. Perhaps these weren't elms, but the same lime trees that grow there today.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="feature" id="1966-81-charingx">
            <h3>Charing Cross Hospital</h3>
            <p>In 1966 this site was still a vast building site after the demolition of Fulham Hospital, with only the block facing Fulham Palace Road completed. You can still see rows of terraced housing and many trees that were destroyed in the construction. Fortunately the plane trees along Fulham Palace Road were preserved.</p>
            <p>The construction of Charing Cross Hospital was completed in 1973 at a cost of £15m, then the most expensive hospital project in the UK to date. It is larger than the footprint of the old Fulham Hospital, with the 3 tower blocks housing nursing staff and the fitness centre occupying what used to be residential streets.</p>

          <div class="feature" id="1966-81-frankbanfield">
            <h3>Frank Banfield Park, Hammersmith Distillery, and Manbré sugar refinery</h3>
            <p>Frank Banfield Park is one of the borough's most recently-created public open spaces, opened in 1974, part of the Fulham riverside development. The park is named after Frank Banfield (1905–1970), Mayor of Fulham in 1952/53. He represented Barons Court on the London County Council, and as an alderman on its replacement, the Greater London Council. It was recently upgraded (2024) with more biodiversity features.</p>
            <p>The housing previously on this site was probably demolished due to <a href="https://www.layersoflondon.org/map/overlays/bomb-damage-1945" target="_blank">1945 bomb damage <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon-small" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>
              <label class="js-special js-bombs1966-81"><input type="checkbox" checked> Show overlay</label>. It also coincides with the demolition of the Manbré and Garton sugar refinery in 1974. The sugar refinery, together with the Hammersmith Distillery, occupied the site between here and the river. They live on in the street names Distillery Road and Manbre Road. You can overlay the 1944-73 Ordnance Survey map to identify the factories. <label class="js-special js-os194473"><input type="checkbox" checked> Show overlay</label>
              Read more about Manbré on <a href="https://edithsstreets.blogspot.com/2016/11/riverside-north-bank-west-of-tower.html" target="_blank">Edith’s Streets  <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon-small" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>.</p>
            <p>In the 1981 photo the sugar refinery site is occupied by large rectangular sheds. I’m not sure what they were used for, but by the late 1990s the site was vacant, apart from new office blocks on Manbre Road at the southern end. The site remained vacant until the Fulham Reach development in the late 2010s.</p>

            <h3>Bayonne Estate and Abbey Gardens</h3>
            <p>This one has particular interest for me as I’ve lived on the Bayonne Estate for 25 years. One of the last housing estates to be built in the borough, the 1981 photo shows it largely completed, but there are still signs of construction and no parked cars. It comprises 434 homes. Many photos of the construction are available on the <a href="https://www.londonpicturearchive.org.uk/quick-search?q=bayonne%20estate&WINID=1729424466762" target="_blank">London Picture Archive <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon-small" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>.</p>
            <p>There is still no sign of Bayonne Park or Abbey Gardens, only the rubble of demolished buildings. Abbey Gardens was developed during the 1980s by Abbey National for the private market. Bayonne Park remained derelict land slated for development, until a resident-led campaign in the 1990s led to its preservation as a public park. You can see them in the <a href="#section-1981-1990">1990 photo</a>.</p>
            <p>The 1966 photo shows the original Victorian terraces that were demolished for the estate’s construction. Many were damaged by WW2 bombing. Their names live on: Ancill Street became Ancill Close, Crefeld Street became Crefeld Close, and Bayonne Road, next to the Twynholm Baptist Church, was reduced to a short cul de sac but gave its name to the estate. Laundry Road refers to the large industrial laundry that was already demolished by 1966 – see the large empty space where the mid-rise block Lampeter Square was built. </p>

            <h3>Aintree Estate</h3>
            <p>The Aintree Estate appears to have been constructed at roughly the same time as the Bayonne Estate, although a large section of the site is already clear in the 1966 photo.</p>
            <p>The H-shaped Hartopp Point & Lannoy Point towers are visible in the 1981 photo. They were demolished in 2023 for health and safety reasons, meaning they lasted just 42 years. The site is currently being redeveloped by Hammersmith & Fulham Council with 134 new homes.</p>

            <h3>Crabtree Pub and Thames Riverside</h3>
            <p>Nothing much changed about the Crabtree Pub. It was already known as a picturesque riverside inn in the late 18th century and it still is today. But other signs of change are visible from 1966 to 1981. </p>
            <p>The barges moored in front of the Crabtree in the 1966 photo give a hint of the continued industrial activity along this stretch of riverside. So are the silos or oil tanks lining the bank further upstream. You can overlay the 1944-73 Ordnance Survey map to identify the factories <label class="js-special js-os194473"><input type="checkbox" checked> Show overlay</label>. By 1981 they had made way for housing.</p>

            <h3>Rowberry Mead and Thames riverside</h3>
            <p>Just south of the Crabtree we see the same change from industry to housing.</p>
            <p>In 1981 we can see the appearance of Rowberry Mead. This small park is surrounded by the sculptural remnants of industrial machinery and silos that were used on the site.</p>
            <p>But before 20th century industry this was the site of the elegant riverside villas Belle Vue and Rosebank. Along the river the area was used to grow and dry osiers for basket making. In the 18th century Rowberry Mead was reputed to be the finest cherry tree orchard in England.

            <h3>River Gardens and FFC</h3>
            <p>Two prominent changes are visible in this area. First is the construction of the serpentine River Gardens development. The other is the appearance of the west stand at the Fulham Football Ground. This has recently been replaced and the riverside walk finally opened for pedestrians.</p>

            <h3>Bayonne Estate and Abbey Gardens</h3>
            <p>In 1981 the Bayonne Estate was just about completed, but Abbey Gardens and Bayonne Park were still derelict. In the 1990 photo you can see the attractively landscaped, winding cul de sacs of Abbey Gardens, and Bayonne Park with its distinctive rows of weeping willows. We have a resident-led campaign to thank for its preservation as a park.</p>
            <p>The Bayonne Estate looks much like it does in the present day, albeit with smaller trees. Next to the Ancill Close parking area, the construction sheds have made way for a large lawn, as well as the sunken court or multi-use game area (MUGA). Next to it, the Bayonne Nursery School has opened.</p>

          <div class="feature" id="1981-92-manbre">
            <h3>Manbré sugar refinery and Hammersmith Distillery</h3>
            <p>By 1981 the Hammersmith Distillery and Manbré sugar refinery had been demolished. The sugar refinery site is occupied by large rectangular sheds. The adjacent preserved food factory still seems to exist (overlay the 1944-73 Ordnance Survey map) – it is a tall building casting a long shadow.</p>
            <p>In the 1990 photo the factory is gone, as are the adjacent sheds, leaving the land clear. By the late 1990s the entire site was vacant, apart from new office blocks on Manbre Road at the southern end. The site remained vacant until the Fulham Reach development in the late 2010s.</p>
